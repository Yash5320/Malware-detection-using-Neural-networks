# Malware Detection Using Android Permission


## Overview
This project focuses on detecting malware in Android applications by analyzing permission data. The process includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and building a machine learning model for classification.

## Requirements
The project uses several R libraries, including `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `DataExplorer`, `caTools`, `randomForest`, `mlbench`, `caret`, `e1071`, `tm`, `SnowballC`, and `wordcloud`.

## Data
The dataset used is `Android_Permission.csv`.

## Steps

1. **Load Libraries and Data**: Import necessary libraries and load the dataset.
2. **Handle Missing Values**: Identify and remove rows with missing values.
3. **Data Exploration**:
   - Visualize the distribution of malware vs benign apps.
   - Analyze category separation for benign and malware apps.
   - Create a stacked bar graph showing malware vs safe apps by category.
4. **Benign Word Cloud**: Generate a word cloud for benign app descriptions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of detecting malware in Android applications using permission data, involving data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and classification.
